Extensive testing was conducted throughout the development process, encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Issues encountered during integration testing, such as inaccuracy detection, were resolved through careful code review and adjustments. For example, negative speed values often came in as an input. This was due to the slight gap between the end of the countdown and the light popping up.

System testing validated the overall functionality and integrity of the game, ensuring a smooth and error-free gaming experience. Testing results indicate that the game functions successfully and does not contain any detectable bugs.
