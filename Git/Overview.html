        <h1>Overview</h1>
<br><br>
My investigation began with a survey of various reaction-based games and activities. I immediately wanted to create something under the ‘concentration level’ headline. I was exploring options ranging from physical reflex games to digital reaction speed challenges. Using Google, I researched different games and activities known to enhance reaction times. While some games relied heavily on luck, I sought options that provided opportunities for players to improve and develop their reaction speeds. 
<br><br>

After considering games like memory tests, mood surveys and puzzles, I concluded that a reaction-speed game would be most suitable for this project. Unlike more complex games, a reaction speed game offers a straightforward and focused way to measure and improve reaction times, aligning well with the objectives of this project. I examined existing digital versions and rules of reaction speed games to inform my design process. 
<br><br>

To streamline development and focus on functionality, I opted not to incorporate graphics into the game. Instead, the game will be rendered in a simple text-based format, allowing for quick implementation and modification. Python was chosen as the programming language for its versatility and my familiarity with it. The game will be designed using a functional programming approach to ensure ease of coding and modification. Utilising the Microbit was beneficial as I needed a way to collect inputs. A serial connection was established from the Microbit code to the python code. This allowed me to create a python code that would perform on the Microbit input, and create an output. Eventually, the results were displayed in a separate file - using csv.
